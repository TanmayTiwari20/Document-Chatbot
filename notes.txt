Load the document using TextLoader and then load()
create a text_splitter object using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
use that object to split the document into chunks
create a vectore to store all the chunks and their vector format
Use Chroma.from_documents and pass the embedding object and the chunks to it
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
Create a retirever which will fetch the info from the vector store
Create a chain object using the RetireverQA.from_chain_type(llm,retirever)

ConversationalRetrievalChain stores the chat history as well.
